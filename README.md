Automated weather classification using Transfer learning From a weather classification perspective, different weather conditions can be classified into categories such as cloudy, rainy, sunny, and sunrise. The task involves training a deep learning model using transfer learning techniques. Transfer learning allows us to leverage pre-trained models that were trained on large datasets to extract meaningful features from images. A popular pre-trained model for image classification is VGG19.Hence we used VGG19 model has been trained on a large dataset of various images and has learned to extract useful features...To apply transfer learning for weather classification, we can use the VGG19 model as a base model and fine-tune it on a dataset specific to weather conditions. The dataset would consist of images representing different weather conditions such as cloudy, rainy, sunny, and sunrise. During the training process, the VGG19 model's pre-trained weights are used as a starting point, and the model is further trained on the weather dataset to adapt the learned features to the specific task of weather classification. This fine-tuning process helps the model learn to recognize patterns and features relevant to different weather conditions. Once the model is trained, it can be used to predict the weather condition of new images. By providing an input image, the model processes the image through its layers, extracts features, and makes predictions based on the learned patterns. The predicted weather condition can then be outputted to provide insights or assist in weather-related applications. It's important to note that weather classification using transfer learning is an example scenario, and the actual implementation details may vary based on specific requirements and datasets
